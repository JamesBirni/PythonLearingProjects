This was my first time messing around with classes in python
I was just trying to learn how polymorphism works.

The goal was simple

-Make a Menu class that has a dictionairy of a menu item and its price
    -This Menu class would take in a name, its items, start time, and end time
    -If a menu object was printed it would say it's name and when it starts and when it ends
    -This Menu class would have a method to calulating the bill at the end of the night

-Make a Franchise class that would represent one store this would have a address and a list of menus
    -If printed a menu object would state it's address
    -This Franchise class would have a way of saying what menus it is currently serving given a time
-Make a Business class that would have a name and a list of Franchises
    -If a business object was printed it would state it's name
