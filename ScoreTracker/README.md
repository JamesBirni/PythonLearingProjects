# PythonScrableScoreKeeper
The goal is to make a project that will allow you to keep track of your scrable game :)
It is a console python program you will need to run it in Python 3
You start by saying how many players there are
Then you go ahead and put in eveyones name
The round starts by asking you if you would like to end the game
Then you say what words you each got
Then the game restarts to line 6
When the game is over it says how many points everyone got and says who wins
